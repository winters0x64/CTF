	You're a Jet all the way
	From your first cigarette
	To your last dyin' day.
	
	When you're a Jet,
	If the spit hits the fan,
	You got brothers around,
	You're a family man.
	
	You're never alone,
	You're never disconnected.
	You're home with your own—
	When company's expected,
	You're well protected!
	
	Then you are set
	With a capital J,
	Which you'll never forget
	Till they cart you away.
	When you're a Jet,
	You stay
	A Jet!
	
	When you're a Jet,
	You're the top cat in town,
	You're the gold-medal kid
	With the heavyweight crown!
	
	When you're a Jet,
	You're the swingin'est thing.
	Little boy, you're a man;
	Little man, you're a king!
	
	The Jets are in gear,
	Our cylinders are clickin'!
	The Sharks'll steer clear,
	'Cause ev'ry Puerto Rican
	'S a lousy chicken!
	
	Here come the Jets
	Like a bat out of hell—
	Someone gets in our way,
	Someone don't feel so well!
	
	Here come the Jets!
	Little world, step aside,
	Better go underground,
	Better run, better hide!
	
	We're drawin' the line,
	So keep your noses hidden!
	We're hangin' a sign
	Says "Visitors Forbidden,"
	And we ain't kiddin'!
	
	Here come the Jets—
	Yeah! And we're gonna beat
	Every last buggin' gang
	On the whole buggin' street!

	"Something's Coming": `Could be . . .
	Who knows? . . .
	There's something due any day—
	I will know right away,
	Soon as it shows.
	It may come cannonballing down through the sky,
	Gleam in its eye,
	Bright as a rose.
	Who knows?
	
	It's only just out of reach,
	Down the block, on a beach,
	Under a tree.
	I got a feeling there's a miracle due,
	Gonna come true,
	Coming to me!
	
	Could it be? Yes, it could.
	Something's coming, something good,
	If I can wait.
	Something's coming, I don't know what it is,
	But it is
	Gonna be great!
	
	With a click, with a shock,
	Phone'll jingle, door'll knock,
	Open the latch.
	Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon;
	Catch the moon,
	One-handed catch!
	
	Around the corner,
	Or whistling down the river,
	Come on, deliver
	To me!
	
	Will it be? Yes, it will.
	Maybe just by holding still,
	It'll be there.
	Come on, something, come on in, don't be shy,
	Meet a guy,
	Pull up a chair!
	
	The air
	Is humming,
	And something great is coming!

	I'll give my cousins a free ride.
	
	How you get all of them inside?
	
	Immigrant goes to America,
	Many hellos in America;
	Nobody knows in America
	Puerto Rico's in America!
	
	I'll bring a T.V. to San Juan.
	
	If there a current to turn on!
	
	I'll give them new washing machine.
	
	What have they got there to keep clean?
	
	I like the shores of America!
	Comfort is yours in America!

	Our fathers all are drunks.
	
	Golly Moses, natcherly we're punks!
	
	Gee, Officer Krupke, we're very upset;
	We never had the love that ev'ry child oughta get.
	We ain't no delinquents,
	We're misunderstood.
	Deep down inside us there is good!
	
	There is good!
	
	There is good, there is good,
	There is untapped good.
	Like inside, the worst of us is good.
	
	That's a touchin' good story.
	
	Lemme tell it to the world!
	
	Just tell it to the judge.
	
	Dear kindly Judge, your Honor,
	My parents treat me rough.
	With all their marijuana,
	They won't give me a puff.
	They didn't wanna have me,
	But somehow I was had.
	Leapin' lizards, that's why I'm so bad!
	
	Right!
	
	Officer Krupke, you're really a square.
	This boy don't need a judge, he needs a analyst's care!
	It's just his neurosis that oughta be curbed.
	He's psychologically disturbed!
	
	I'm disturbed!
	
	We're disturbed, we're disturbed,
	We're the most disturbed,
	Like we're psychologically disturbed.
	
	In the opinion on this court, 
	this child is depraved on account he ain't had a normal home.
	
	Hey, I'm depraved on account I'm deprived.

	My father is a bastard,
	My ma's an S.O.B.

	Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess!
	
	Yes!
	Officer Krupke, you're really a slob.

	And sociologically he's sick!
	
	I am sick!
	
	We are sick, we are sick,
	We are sick, sick, sick,
	Like we're sociologically sick!
	
	In my opinion, this child don't need to have his head shrunk at all.

	Hey, I got a social disease!
	
	So take him to a social worker!
	
	Dear kindly social worker,
	They say go earn a buck.

	I'm no good!
	
	We're no good, we're no good!
	We're no earthly good,
	Like the best of us is no damn good!

	The trouble is he drinks.
	
	The trouble is he's lazy.
	
	The trouble is he stinks.
	
	The trouble is he's growing.
	
	The trouble is he's grown.
	
	Krupke, we got troubles of our own!
